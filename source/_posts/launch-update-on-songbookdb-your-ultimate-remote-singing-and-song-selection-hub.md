## Launch Update on SongbookDB – Your Ultimate Remote Singing and Song Selection Hub

[![songbookdb announcement](https://i2.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/songbookdb-announcement.jpg?resize=706%2C321&ssl=1)](https://i2.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/songbookdb-announcement.jpg?fit=706%2C360&ssl=1 "songbookdb announcement")

If you’re a [Karaoki](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) customer and use [SongbookDB](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) for remote singer/song requests, please review the following message from Shaun Thompson, the creator.

Hi KJs and DJs,

I’ll be releasing an update for Pal next Monday.

![](https://i0.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/songbookdb.jpg?fit=251%2C300&ssl=1 "songbookdb")

The update will require most of you to uninstall the current version of Pal before installing the new version, otherwise you will see the following error:

> “Sorry, an error has occurred. The application cannot be installed due to a certificate problem. The certificate does not match the installed application certificate, does not support application updates, or is invalid. Please contact the application author.”

I recommend that you uninstall Pal and install the version I will be releasing next week in advance of any gigs that you might have so that you don’t have to go though the process while you’re at a show.

Future updates will simply update the current version ie no need to uninstall it first.

This latest version deals with the venue creation issue that some users have been experiencing. Also, most admin of song books will take place on the website [HERE](https://www.songbookdb.com/dashboard) instead of in Pal.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you,

**Shaun Thomson**
