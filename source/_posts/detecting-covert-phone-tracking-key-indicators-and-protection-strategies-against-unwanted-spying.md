### Unexpected Screen Activity

Has your phone ever spontaneously lit up, sans any apparent reason? If your device springs to life while in standby mode without any manual input from you, it’s a potential red flag. This could imply tracking or data harvesting processes running in the background. 

### Unexplained Data and Battery Usage

If you’ve been keeping tabs on your monthly mobile data usage and battery life (who isn’t?), sudden and inexplicable spikes might raise eyebrows. If you can’t attribute these to your latest Netflix binge-watch, you might be dealing with covert spy apps that are quietly using your network to download and transmit collected data.

### The Mysterious Green Dot: Camera and Location Access

Next time you spot a green dot on the top corner of your phone, take a moment. If this dot pops up when you’re not using your camera, it’s time to consider potential malicious activity. The same applies to unexpected GPS or location access, which could appear even when you’re not using related apps.

### Sluggish Phone Performance: Is Your Device Overworked?

Is your device running slower than usual, using more battery power, and heating up? Besides being a nuisance, this could be a tell-tale sign that spy apps are overtaxing your phone’s resources.

### Odd Noises During Phone Calls

Hearing peculiar sounds, echoes, or distant voices during your phone calls? It might not be a case of poor reception. Someone could be eavesdropping on your conversations.

## Is Your Phone Really Being Monitored?

Have you noticed some of the signs above? Before we jump to conclusions, there are steps you can take to validate if your phone is being tracked.

### Your Google Account and Device Connections

Begin by checking the devices linked to your Google account. This can help identify if your account is being accessed from an unfamiliar device. If you spot an unknown device or suspicious activity, it’s time to revoke its access.

### The Bitly Trick: A Spy Trap

Here’s a nifty trick using [Bit.ly](https://bit.ly). Send a shortened link with a tempting message to a friend (who knows not to open it). If you see clicks on your Bitly dashboard, it could indicate someone else is snooping on your messages and clicking the link.

### Is Your Device Rooted?

Rooting an Android device offers users the liberty to install unapproved apps, an ideal playground for spyware. If your device has been rooted without your consent, that’s a strong sign of suspicious activities. You can use an app like[Root Checker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joeykrim.rootcheck&hl=en&gl=US) to confirm if your device has been rooted.

### Device Administration: Who’s in Charge?

Device Administration is a safety measure on Android. Though intended to improve your phone’s performance, it can be exploited by malicious actors to track or record data. It’s prudent to check and [remove hidden device administrators](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) on your Android device.

### Inspect Your App List

Do you know every app installed on your phone? With countless apps downloaded and forgotten about, it’s easy to lose track. It’s time to sift through your app list. If there’s an app you don’t remember installing or that seems dubious, uninstall it right away.

### Consider a Factory Reset

This might seem extreme, but it can be necessary. A factory reset scrubs your phone clean, eliminating any potential monitoring programs. Yes, it requires time and effort to restore your phone’s settings, but isn’t your privacy worth it?

## How to be Safe from Phone Tracking

### Install an Anti-Malware App

## FAQs

**Can someone track my phone without me knowing?** 

Unfortunately, yes. But by taking the measures we’ve outlined above, you can significantly mitigate this risk.

**How to know if your phone is being tracked by the police?** 

This can be difficult to ascertain. In most cases, you won’t know unless the police disclose this information. However, if your phone is behaving unusually (rapid battery drain, strange noises, etc.), it could be a sign of surveillance.
