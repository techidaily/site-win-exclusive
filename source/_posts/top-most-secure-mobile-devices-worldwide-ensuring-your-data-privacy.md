## Top Most Secure Mobile Devices Worldwide: Ensuring Your Data Privacy

Our smartphones know almost everything about us that even our closest friend or spouse doesn’t know. If we look at modern smartphones, they are equipped with so many hardware and software components that ensure security is maintained and privacy is intact. The features such as fingerprint scanner, retinal scanner, face recognition, and more are now not limited to only luxury phones.

Despite being such security and privacy-concerned, we regularly get news of privacy breaches and [malware attacks on Android](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) or even [iPhones](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/). The main reason behind such security violations is the applications we use on our phones. Many apps, especially on Android, are data-hungry, even the legitimate ones like [Google’s Apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/). They track and consume so much private information on our phones and use it for their benefits, such as targeting the ads. Another reason is loosely designed hardware. Although the modern phone does have many features, as already mentioned, like a retinal scanner and all, they still can be easily hacked by professional hackers. It is because privacy and security are never the main objectives of most smartphone manufacturers. Primarily, the mobile companies look for providing more and more usability on their phones like a good camera, more storage, higher RAM, more incredible processing speed, etc.

Many people are more concerned for their security and privacy rather than the funky features like cameras, storage, etc. Luckily for them, few smartphone manufacturers are dedicated to building specially designed smartphones just for privacy and security enthusiasts. 

In this post, we would have a look at some of those smartphones, which are popularly known as the most secure phones on the earth.

## KATIM Phone

![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/katim.png)

KATIM phone is the flagship smartphone of the DarkMatter organization, which is famous for providing the tightest privacy and security services. With the launch of KATIM, the DarkMatter has provided the security buffs with the phone that has the most secure hardware and software.

The KATIM phone runs on the specially designed KATIM OS, surprisingly based on hardened Android OS. On every boot, the KATIM OS validates the device for any modifications. If the validation fails, the boot-up is aborted, and the phone does not start.

KATIM Phone is designed in such as way that if a potential security attack is detected, whether on hardware or software, the phone would automatically initiate the process of wiping off the whole device. The phone also comes with self-destructing message feature. KATIM is also certified with IP67 that makes it waterproof and dustproof.

As far as privacy is concerned, the KATIM OS comes with an advanced technology known as the Shield Mode button, which automatically disables the camera, microphone, motion sensor, GPS, Bluetooth, etc., when not in use. Further, it has eavesdrop protection, too, so that nobody else other than you can see the data on your phone in your absence.

On top of everything, the KATIM mobile supports remote management as well. The owner can not only monitor the phone in case it is stolen or left out somewhere but also lock it, wipe it, delete specific items, and also blacklist certain applications that nobody else can access. Isn’t it amazing?

## Sirin Solarin

![solarin](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/solarin.png)

Solarin from Sirin is probably the most expensive smartphone, which costs more than US$16,000\. Naturally, the potential targets of the company are those consumers who can willingly afford such a high-priced smartphone. Such a heavy price should automatically assure you the tightest security and privacy.

With Solarin, the consumers get customizable security and privacy features. The Sirin, in collaboration with the security company KoolSpan, has provided a unique technology in Solarin that guarantees you:

* Sending the messages with AES-256 encryption
* Private Voice over IP (VoIP) phone calls
* FIPS140-2 encryption on communication

Since the consumers pay such a hefty amount, what better they get compared to other security and privacy-focused phones? The answer is Zimperium – an army of Cyber bodyguards. The Zimperium is a group of specialists that guards your device by detecting unknown and potential threats using advanced threat intelligence. If a threat is detected, the Zimperium would immediately tackle it with the help of a security administrator.

Canadian smartphone giant BlackBerry is one of the few popular smartphone manufacturers that also concentrate on developing privacy and security-focused mobile phones. BlackBerry Key2 is one such device from the company. 

For providing better privacy, the BlackBerry Key2 comes with Mozilla Firefox as the default browser. The Firebox blocks the trackers and automatically deletes the browsing history after use. Traditionally, BlackBerry devices come with the DTEK technology. The DTEK technology lets you monitor what system resources an application is using in real-time. With DTEK, you can know when an app:

* access your contact
* send a text
* turn on or off the microphone
* take a picture or record a video
* access your calendar

In terms of security, the DTEK periodically evaluates your phone and reports the security level.

## Blackphone 2

![blackphone 2](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blackphone-2.png)

Popular among the business personnel, Blackphone 2 is another security and privacy-centric smartphone that has multiple security levels and can run multiple OS on a single device. The device comes with a privacy-oriented hard Android OS known as SilentOS or PrivateOS. The OS encrypts every message of the default messaging app and other communication apps of the device. The privacy feature of the Blackphone 2 also encrypts the email, calls, and other data that can lead to a potential data breach. Furthermore, it also allows users to select what they allow to gather from their phones.

## iPhone 12 Pro Max

![iPhone 12 pro max](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/iPhone-12-pro-max.png)

As compared to Android, iOS is said to be a more secure and privacy-focused operating system, and the latest iPhone 12 Pro Max proves it absolutely correct. Apart from other basic features like top camera and design, the iPhone 12 Pro Max comes with many privacy-rich options.

If your phone is lost or you cannot locate it, then unlike Android, as long as nobody else knows your passcode, you can be assured that your privacy is unimpaired with your iPhone. It comes with advanced sandboxing encryption that isolates apps from each other and also restricts them from using any resource that you don’t want to be used. Because of sandboxing, a malicious app could not spread across the device and would become inactive. As far as security is concerned, the iPhone comes with the latest advanced facial recognition that has been tested with millions of faces and works excellent.

## Bottom Line

This guide walks through the list of the five most secure phones you can get. However, almost every one of them is so expensive that a commoner can’t afford it. With most of our personal data stored in the phone and today almost everyone uses their smartphones for banking transactions, it is essential that smartphone manufacturers should keep security and privacy on top of the priority while designing the phone and make such phones affordable to everyone.
