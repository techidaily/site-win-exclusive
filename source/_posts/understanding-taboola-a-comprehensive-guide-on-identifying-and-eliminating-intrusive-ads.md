## What is Taboola?

Taboola is a legit advertising network that is sometimes used by apps that aren’t always trustworthy. Most of these apps lie about how they improve Internet browsing by adding “useful” features, but they often sneak onto systems without users’ permission.

These ads might be malicious or they might not. But they can be misleading, and you might buy fake products, fall for a scam, or lose private information because of them. By redirecting pages to show ads, they definitely make it hard to browse.
