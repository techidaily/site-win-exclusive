The latest iteration of Numark’s DJ2GO series of ultra-compact DJ controllers is now supported by DEX 3, building on our list of 100+ [DEX 3 supported controllers](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/).

Just like it’s predecessor the DJ2Go2, the [**DJ2Go2 Touch**](https://www.numark.com/product/dj2go2-touch) is a portable, pocket-sized DJ controller, but with the improved capability for scratching with capacitive touch jog wheels. With a built-in sound card, it fits perfectly in front of your laptop. It’s truly one of the best portable DJ controller values on the market at only $79 (USD) at most online DJ equipment retailers.

The DJ2GO2 Touch comes equipped with the essentials: Two channels, a crossfader, jog-wheels and pitch faders. With 8 pads and four pad modes for total-control of cue-points, auto / manual looping and sample playback, DJ2GO2 Touch provides features usually only found on full-size controllers. The built-in 2-stereo-channel audio interface makes headphone pre-fade listening (using [WASAPI](https://wiki.jriver.com/index.php/WASAPI) in Windows and [Core Audio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core%5FAudio) on MAC) easy without the need for an additional USB audio interface.

The Numark DJ2GO2 Touch provides full 2-deck control over [DEX 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) or [DEX 3 RE](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) and only takes a few seconds to setup as it doesn’t require driver installation or additional hardware. Simply connect the USB cable, connect your headphones, and you’re ready to play.

Just like its predecessor, a controller popular with DEX 3 DJs, the Numark DJ2Go2 Touch is a great option for pop up parties, smaller events, karaoke events, and practice. A great unit to have in your arsenal if you’re a Mobile DJ.
