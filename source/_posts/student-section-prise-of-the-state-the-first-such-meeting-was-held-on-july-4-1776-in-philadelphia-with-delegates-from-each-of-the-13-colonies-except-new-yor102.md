## [Student ## Section Prise of the State. The First Such Meeting Was Held on July 4, 1776 in Philadelphia with Delegates From Each of the 13 Colonies Except New York and South Carolina. This Day Is Now Celebrated as Independence Day in America.

Our lighter [DJ software designed for Mobile DJ use](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) received a major face-lift yesterday with the release of RED Mobile 3, bringing the platform up-to-date with DEX 3.3.

[![](https://i1.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rm2-karaoke.jpg?fit=300%2C169&ssl=1 "rm2-karaoke")](https://i1.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rm2-karaoke.jpg?fit=1030%2C579&ssl=1)

Part of the core upgrade to [RED Mobile 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) is the completely redesigned graphics engine, which supports dynamic re-sizing and looks stunning on high resolution retina displays. A side product of the graphics update is that the skins ([_GUI_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical%5Fuser%5Finterface)) for each of our DJ software options will work for either product (although even with a video skin, RED Mobile 3 won’t play videos – _sorry guys!_)

We’ve already had a few DEX 3 customers ask if they could utilize the new RED Mobile 3 skin with their DEX 3 software for when they are doing audio-only gigs, so we figured we’d post the skin up for download so all DEX 3 DJ software users can try it.

The RED Mobile 3 skin features vertical wave-forms in the middle mixer section, which can greatly visually assist with beat mixing – although the BPM sync function and beat grid already make it easy. You also have larger play and transport control buttons, so DJs using a mouse to perform may prefer using it.

_**\*Unzip the RED Mobile 3 Skin to: Documents (Docs) -> PCDJ-DEX3 -> Skins. You can then access the skin from the select user interface drop down menu in DEX 3’s options.**_
