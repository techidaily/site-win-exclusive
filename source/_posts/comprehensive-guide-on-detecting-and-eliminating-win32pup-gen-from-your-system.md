Win32:pup-gen is a generic label for the malicious program detected by Avast and other antimalware programs. It is classified as a [Potentially Unwanted Program (PUP)](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) since users don’t install it willingly on their system.

Here are the steps to eliminate the temporary files:

1. Open the Run command window.
2. Type **%temp%** and hit the enter key.![temp run command](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/temp-run-command.png)
3. This run command would navigate you to this path: **_C:\\Users\\\[username\]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp,_** that is, the temp folder.

## How to Avoid Win32:pup-gen?

It is essential to avoid such PUPs so that you do not have to deal with them. Here are some tips for that:

1. Never fall into the trap of attractive pop-ups and banner ads.

****Is a PUP dangerous?** 

A potentially unwanted program (PUP) might not be dangerous by itself, but it often utilizes high amounts of system resources and can be responsible for the infiltration of other threatening malware.

****Should I delete PUP?** 

Though a PUP is not dangerous, it is still ‘Unwanted’. So it must be deleted from the system immediately after its discovery.
