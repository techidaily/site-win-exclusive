## What is uTorrent?

uTorrent is a software that enables peer-to-peer sharing via Bit Torrent. The uTorrent is developed by Bit Torrent and is widely known in the torrent world. This is because of its efficient services that compete with some of the greatest torrent providers. You can use the uTorrent to share data and files over the internet. The specialty of the uTorrent is that it lets you transfer large files at a high speed.

The uTorrent was launched in September 2005 and has been a prime choice of users since then. While uTorrent has been serving its audience to the best of its capabilities, there were [certain allegations](https://torrentfreak.com/utorrent-continues-to-be-flagged-as-severe-threat-and-its-not-alone-210318/) made regarding the safety of uTorrent recently.

## Is uTorrent Safe or Virus?

Although uTorrent proved to be an efficient software when it comes to peer-to-peer data sharing, there were [certain instances](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/200602-utorrent-accused-of-bundling-cryptocurrency-malware-with-popular-bittorrent-client) that led its users to believe that the software is not safe to use. Firstly, a version of uTorrent was seen manipulating the interface of the user’s browser without their consent. This made users feel that their privacy was compromised. Later, the developers of uTorrent started running advertisements in the free version of the application. This again created a negative impact on the audience. 

Many instances falsely labeled uTorrent as a red flag among the audience. Surprisingly, not all of these allegations were true. It is important to note that numerous unofficial variants of uTorrent were being developed, and downloading the application from unknown sources was a primary reason for these issues. However, it cannot be said explicitly that uTorrent is safe application, but it is safer than many other torrent software.
