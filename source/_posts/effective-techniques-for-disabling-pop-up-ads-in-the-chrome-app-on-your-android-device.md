## Effective Techniques for Disabling Pop-Up Ads in the Chrome App on Your Android Device

Advertisements can appear on practically any part of your Android devices. However, your Google Chrome browser is the most vulnerable of all apps. Just like its desktop counterpart, Android Chrome is regularly exposed to many ads online from pop-ups to intrusive advertisements.

## Use Google Chrome’s Native Ad Blocker

Google Chrome for Android employs native ad blocking mechanism that will protect you from most adverts. However, it is not enabled by default. To turn it on, launch Google Chrome. Then, touch the triple-dot menu on the upper right corner of the browser.

![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/1-1.png)

1\. Press the **Three Vertical Dots**

![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2-1.png)

2\. Choose **Settings**.

![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/3-1.png)

3\. On Settings, choose **Site settings**.

![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/4-1.png)

4\. On Site settings, choose **Ads**.

![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/5-1.png)

5\. **Toggle off** the switch on the Ads page.

It must be noted that this feature is more of ad limiter and not ad blocker. You will still see Ads on webpages but there would be no annoying popups or noisy auto-play video ads.

[Malwarebytes Lifetime License: How to Buy Legally?](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)

Even with Google’s tool turned on, many annoying and privacy-invading ads will still get through.

To get rid of ads completely from all the webpages, you will need a third-party ad blocker. 

We recommend Total AdBlock which comes for free bundled when you buy TotalAV. It is not just an ad blocking tool but an award winning Antivirus solution for your mobile device as well as computers.

## Install AdGuard for Android

[AdGuard](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) is a one-of-a-kind app that blocks ads everywhere on your mobile device. It stops ads in your browser, games, apps, and websites that you frequently use or visit. **The app available on Play Store does not natively support Google Chrome.** You can use it to block ads on Yandex and Samsung browser only.

![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ADGUARD-Android-Chrome-Compatibility-Issue.webp "ADGUARD-Android-Chrome-Compatibility-Issue")

However, there is a workaround. There is another variant of AdGuard app available on the official website. You can [download the APK from here](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/).

Please understand that this app cannot be published on Google Play store due to Policy restrictions. So, you must install it directly from APK.

To Proceed your Device must allow **installing Apps from Unknown sources**. 

Tap the downloaded AdGuard APK file and then Install. If installations from a browser are not allowed, you’ll get a notification. In this notification, **tap Settings → Allow from this source → Back → Install**.

After installation, you will be shown this Welcome page. **Click on Quick Setup** at the bottom.

To block ads, AdGuard uses Local VPN for filtering out ads from Google Chrome browser. It does not use remote server but traffic routing is done on local device itself.

[How to Choose Best Antivirus for Windows 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)

To do that, click on **Create Local VPN** and Press OK on the prompt pop-up.

![Create Local VPN on AdGuard](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Create-Local-VPN-on-AdGuard.webp "Create Local VPN on AdGuard")

Now, simply toggle the Protection switch and browse the web ad-free.

## Fine Tune with DNS66

[DNS66](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.jak%5Flinux.dns66/) is an excellent ad blocking app that allows blocking of hostnames via DNS. It does not require your mobile device to be rooted. The application reroutes your connection to a DNS server where it filters the traffic that only allows queries for hosts, not on the blacklist.

Download DNS66 on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.jak%5Flinux.dns66/) which is a trusted app directory for free and open source Android programs. You have to allow your system to install apps from unknown sources. Go to **Settings**. Choose **Security**.

![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/10-1.png)

Turn on the dial for **Unknown sources**. If there is any confirmation pop-up window, choose **OK**.

![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/11-1.png)

Launch the DNS66 app. To start the VPN services, click the **Start** button on the first tab.

Then, go to **Hosts** tab. By default, the application lists various host file sources with StevenBlack’s enabled. If you want to block ads from other host file sources, choose them from the list.

![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/16.png)

Then, choose **Deny** on the dropdown list on the next page. Touch the check logo on the upper right corner to confirm.

![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/17.png)

If you want to add your own host file source, choose the blue plus button and follow the instructions.

## Take Back Your Browser with Bromite

[Bromite](https://www.bromite.org/) is a browser focused on enhanced privacy and ad blocking. It is based on Chromium, which is also the basis of the Google Chrome browser. The browser app makes web ad blocking a lot simpler by having the mechanism integrated into the browser itself.

[What Viruses Actually Do to Your Phone?](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)

Launch Bromite then open the triple-dot menu on the upper right corner. Check **Enable AdBlock**. If you want extra protection, you can uncheck **Enable Javascript**.

![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/18.png)

## Install AdBlock Plus

[AdBlock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/android-install) offers an alternative outside Chromium-based browsers. It provides faster browsing by blocking ads natively. Moreover, it protects your data and privacy during browsing by blocking tracking mechanisms.

The browser does a good job of protecting you by default. However, you can add more layers of protection. Open the triple-dot menu, then select **Settings**.

![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/19.png)

Under **Settings**, choose **Ad blocking**.

![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/20.png)

On the next page, choose **More blocking options**.

![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/21.png)

Check all four options under **More blocking options**. This will protect you from tracking, malware, anti-ad blocking messages, and social media buttons.

## Install AdAway For Your Rooted Device

[AdAway](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.adaway/) is one of the best ad-blocking apps if your device is already rooted. It uses hosts files to block ads, so it protects your entire system. Moreover, it is lightweight enough to run on any mobile phones without consuming CPU power or memory. This is especially essential if you have an older phone.

![](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/23.png)

It is open source and free which also allows you to select your own sources of hosts files. Additionally, you can fine-tune the blocked ads using Whitelist and Blacklist.

## Final Thoughts

Avoiding annoying ads starts with clean browsing habits. Ensure that you are only visiting secure sites. Also, running an ad-blocking app and anti-malware protection will add layers of security in case any ads get through. Regularly schedule a full system scan as well to remove any hidden adware.

The first way in this article is backwards. Following those instructions disables the minimal ad blocking functionality that Chrome for Android has enabled by default.  
It doesn’t block much (only ads known to Google to be “intrusive or misleading”) but it’s still probably better to leave it on than to disable it.

   No, it’s \*not\* backwards. Leaving it on allows all ads. Turning it off blocks “intrusive and misleading ads.” Because it’s not intuitive, most probably leave it on, which Google surely likes.

Your listing states Ad Blocker for android Chrome phones, but I can’t find anything that applies to that topic. I’ve downloaded Ad Blocker onto my Samsung android phone, but it’s not blocking the ads. The phone came with game apps and the constant ads are driving me nuts! Do you have any suggestions? FYI, I’m a disabled senior who relies on the games to keep mind occupied since I don’t care for daytime TV so I’d appreciate any help you can give me. Thank you in advance.

Brave browser, you can make the interface identical to Chrome, and underneath its engine is Chromium. So you have a chrome like browser without any ads.
