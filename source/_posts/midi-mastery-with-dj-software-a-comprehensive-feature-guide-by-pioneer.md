## MIDI Mastery with DJ Software: A Comprehensive Feature Guide by Pioneer

[![](https://i1.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/djmixingsoftware-midilearn.jpg?resize=631%2C270&ssl=1)](https://i1.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/djmixingsoftware-midilearn.jpg?fit=631%2C358&ssl=1 "djmixingsoftware-midilearn")

**Our DJ software applications, DEX 2 and RED Mobile 2 (as well as the [upcoming version 3 upgrades](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/)) already natively support over 60 popular [DJ Controllers](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) from all the top manufacturers.** 

**DJ MIDI Controllers** with built-in support are "zero-configure"; simply have the controller plugged into your computer and turned on and either of our **DJ mixing software** applications with find the controller on startup and intialize it. The only manual configuration necessary is selecting how you want the audio output setup under the audio tab in options.  

That's great if your **DJ controller** (or MIDI controller) is one of the 60 directly supported DJ controllers, _but what if your shiney new controller isn't yet supported?_   

We add support for new DJ controllers all the time, but with the popular [**DJ equipment**](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) manufacturers such as Numark and Pioneer releasing fresh controller designs at break-neck speeds, we can't always write support immediately.   **Enter in our exclusive and unique "MIDI Learn" feature…**[![MIDIlearn-DJsoftware-DEX](https://pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MIDIlearn-DJsoftware-DEX-1024x575.jpg)](https://pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MIDIlearn-DJsoftware-DEX.jpg) 

"**MIDI Learn**" provides our DJ software customers the ability to visually map any **DJ controller** using MIDI communication and/or map any keyboard key to any on-screen function. The feature has been designed so that anyone can do it very easily without learning to program or edit scripts. It's an excellent option for those that have **DJ MIDI Controllers** we don't yet natively support, but "**MIDI Learn**" does have some limitations. 

For instance, most DJ controllers with Platters/Jog Wheels are not created equal. Per revolution of a controller platter or jog wheel each device will send different signals at various intervals — so in most cases proper and advanced platter/jog wheel support needs to be done with our development team in-house. 

However, any button, slider or knob found on-screen in our **PCDJ DEX 2 or RED Mobile 2 DJ software** platforms can be mapped easily and seamlessly with buttons, sliders or knobs on the MIDI controller (or to keyboard shortcuts). 

**Here is a video tutorial on how to use our "MIDI Learn" feature with our DJ Mixing Software:**
