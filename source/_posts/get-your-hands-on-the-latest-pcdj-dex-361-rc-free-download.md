**Tweaking code so you can tweak knobs – The DEX 3.6.1 release candidate is available for download!**

The updated 3.6.1 version of DEX 3 is a [release candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software%5Frelease%5Flife%5Fcycle); it requires one more round of public field testing before being issued as the full release.

Along with droves of DEX 3 **DJ program** users we’ve been beating up on the 3.6.1 public beta for the last week and have managed to find, and squash, a few bugs. One particularly nasty critter caused a near-immediate crash when loading/playing songs due to a system file that was inadvertently affecting buffering tracks into RAM.

On the flip-side we’ve received copious reports of **snappier overall responsiveness, better stability and tighter DJ controller communication** with the previous public beta — the refactored audio engine and rewiring of other core functions has improved DEX 3’s performance. A stronger foundation lends nicely to **many of the new features planned for the next free update** and beyond.

We invite all DEX 3 DJs and potential users to download and try the DEX 3.6.1 release candidate, our flagship **DJ software for mixing audio, music videos and karaoke**.

**NOTE:** Since version 3.6.1 is a release candidate we recommend testing thoroughly before DJing live. You can post any reports on the DEX 3 user forum [HERE](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/)
