While there are [many options available to choose an antimalware](https://www.viruspup.com/software/best-antimalware.html) that suits your system’s compatibility and your budget, for Windows 10 users, Windows Defender does an excellent job.

Windows Defender is the inbuilt security solution of Windows. Though previously, it used to be heavily criticized because of its low effectiveness, from the past few years, Microsoft has improved a lot in it, and today it is one of the top security programs available.

Though, it is not free from bugs, and a lot of users frequently complaints about errors in it. One such error is this message:
