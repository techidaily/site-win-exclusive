### What Are Application Dependencies?

Application dependencies encompass various components a program needs to function effectively. These include:

* **File Dependencies**: These are essential files, like DLLs, EXEs, or other resource files, that an application relies on. These files may be stored in various locations on the system and must be captured and included in the installation package in order for the application to execute correctly on target computers..
* **Registry Settings**: Many applications need specific registry keys or values set up to operate correctly. Gaining an understanding of an applicationâ€™s registry demands and ensuring these settings are part of the package is vital.
* **Prerequisite Software**: These are software components, such as database servers or runtime libraries, that must be present for the primary application to function. Their identification and incorporation into the package are necessary for the smooth running of the application on target systems.
* **Hardware Requirements**: Specific hardware prerequisites, like a particular processor type or amount of RAM, are necessary for some applications. Users must be aware of these requirements to ensure compatibility.

File dependencies are files that an application needs to work properly, such as DLLs, EXEs, or other resource files. These files may be stored in various locations on the system and must be captured and included in the installation package in order for the application to execute correctly on target computers.

Identifying and including file dependencies can be difficult since it necessitates a thorough grasp of the application's file structure as well as the tools and technologies used to capture and include these files in the installation package.

Registry settings are another important component of application dependencies, as many applications require specific registry keys or values to be set in order to function correctly. These settings need to be captured and included in the installation package to ensure that the application can run correctly on target systems. The process of identifying and including registry settings can be complex, as it requires a deep understanding of the application's registry structure and the tools and technologies used to capture and include these settings in the installation package.

Prerequisite software refers to other software components that an application requires to function correctly, such as database servers, web servers, or runtime libraries. These components may need to be installed before the application can be installed, and they need to be documented and included in the installation package to ensure that the application can run correctly on target systems. The process of identifying and including prerequisite software can be challenging, as it requires a deep understanding of the application's requirements and the tools and technologies used to capture and include these components in the installation package.

Hardware requirements refer to specific hardware components that an application requires to function correctly, such as a particular processor type, amount of RAM, or graphics card. These requirements need to be documented and communicated to users to ensure that they have the necessary hardware to run the application. The process of identifying and documenting hardware requirements can be complex, as it requires a deep understanding of the application's requirements and the hardware components that are required to support these requirements.

By understanding application dependencies and documenting them thoroughly, IT professionals can create installation packages that are reliable and efficient, and can be installed easily on target systems. 

Basically, application dependencies can be broken down into three areas:

* System dependencies
* Software Dependencies
* Other/Custom Dependencies

### Assessing Application Compatibility

Evaluating application compatibility is an important element of the MSI packaging process, especially for IT professionals in charge of big enterprise setups. 

This process actively identifies and addresses compatibility challenges before application rollout. Such compatibility issues could lead to application malfunctions or failures, frustrating users and risking enterprise downtime.

One of the main reasons for evaluating application compatibility is to ensure that the application will work properly on the target system. This entails examining the program's system requirements in order to determine the minimum hardware and software needs for the application to work properly. To avoid compatibility concerns, IT professionals must ensure that the target system matches certain baseline criteria.

**Examining the application's dependencies** is another crucial component of determining application compatibility. This includes determining which third-party software components, such as runtimes or drivers, are required for the application to perform properly. Before installing the application, IT professionals must ensure that these dependencies are installed on the target system. Failure to install these dependencies may result in the program failing or functioning incorrectly.

Another important part of determining program compatibility is **compatibility testing**. This entails running the program on a variety of target systems in order to find any compatibility concerns. Prior to deployment, IT workers must test the program on various hardware and software configurations to discover and resolve potential issues.

Reviewing the application's system requirements is one of the first steps in determining VLC compatibility. VLC requires Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.7 or later, and a kernel version of 2.6.32 or later on Linux. To avoid compatibility concerns, IT professionals must ensure that the target system matches certain baseline criteria.  
Another critical part of determining VLC compatibility is to examine the application's dependencies. To play various media kinds, VLC requires specific codecs and plugins, and IT professionals must guarantee that these dependencies are installed on the target machine. Failure to install these dependencies may result in the program failing or functioning incorrectly.  
Examining the application's dependencies is also an important component in determining VLC compatibility. VLC requires appropriate codecs and plugins to play various media types, and IT professionals must ensure that these dependencies are installed on the target PC. If certain requirements are not installed, the software may fail or function poorly.  
When evaluating VLC's compatibility, keep in mind the impact of any updates or patches that may be released for the application. These upgrades may have an influence on the application's compatibility with the target system, and  
Consider the impact of any updates or patches that may be released for the application when evaluating VLC's compatibility. These updates may impact the application's compatibility with the target system.  

Application compatibility testing has become much easier with time because nowadays organizations usually only run on a single OS version (unlike in the past where we had multiple OSes like XP, Vista, 7 in the same infrastructure) and patching/IPU (in place upgrades) have become more easy to manage and are released on a steady basis from Microsoft. Basically IT Professionals must test the application compatibility on a single system with 1 or 2 branches.

In conclusion, assessing application compatibility is a critical aspect of the MSI packaging process, particularly for IT professionals responsible for managing large enterprise environments.

 IT workers can assure that an application will run appropriately on target systems by thoroughly testing application compatibility, lowering the risk of downtime and user displeasure. 

The use of tools and technology to automate the assessment and resolution of compatibility issues can improve efficiency and effectiveness. 

It is critical to keep up with the current trends and technologies in the field of application compatibility to ensure that MSI packages are dependable, efficient, and simple to maintain.
