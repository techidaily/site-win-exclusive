**Recent Karaoke Music Updates** 

Accumulating a **commercially legal karaoke catalog** is expensive, time-consuming, and distracts you from running your business, and thanks to convoluted [![1492153_307095869447162_1352840172270239779_o](https://pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1492153_307095869447162_1352840172270239779_o-300x225.jpg)](https://pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1492153%5F307095869447162%5F1352840172270239779%5Fo.jpg)copyright and trademark laws, as a KJ it's hard to be sure that what you're playing is strictly legal for public performance. That's why _**Digitrax Entertainment**_ (The Karaoke Cloud Pro creators, formally Chartbuster Karaoke) has gone to great lengths to assemble a terrific catalog, aggregating the best hits from the world's premier karaoke studios, and licensed that content with the major publishers, with more coming onboard all the time. Karaoke Cloud Pro is a [**_professional karaoke subscription_**](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/).

[**Karaoke Cloud Pro**](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) has been a very pleasant surprise for PCDJ. We truly didn't know what to expect when we were the first to integrate the subscription into our karaoke software. We get new KJ subscribers daily, with both military bases and chain restaurants becoming regular users of the platform. It's a quick fix to immediately have a quality core karaoke catalog, with new and recent karaoke releases added by simply logging into your subscription though PCDJ Karaoki [**Karaoke Software**](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) and updating the catalog file.
