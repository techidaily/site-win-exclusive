## 9 Signs of Spyware on Android Phone

## 1\. Your Phone is Sluggish

An app that spies on you requires many resources to run than a standard app. It will consume your RAM and CPU to perform the task. Due to this, your phone becomes sluggish. If you find that your smartphone isn’t performing well, then it could be a sign of spyware infection. However, there are other numerous reasons for phone becoming slow. It could be due to some faulty app that is consuming all your resources. So, if your phone is slow, you can’t be sure that someone is spying on you, it still is a sign.

## 2\. Unusual Behaviour

If your phone has the spyware, then there are good chances that the device will perform differently. Cybercriminals don’t bother to optimize the malware app properly; they want access to your device. Such apps cause several incompatibility issues, and you could see unusual behaviour. Your phone could close or open an app automatically. It could restart or shutdown automatically. You can also hear some strange noises from your device.

Such behaviours don’t necessarily mean that you have spyware. It could be due to a buggy update in one of your good app. Or due to some hardware malfunction, you could also experience abnormal behaviour in your device.

## 3\. Strange Text or Multimedia Messages

Spyware apps could send text messages from your device. You may also receive text messages from cybercriminals who tries to exploit the Android OS vulnerability. Such messages may contain codes and symbol. If you see such a message in your inbox, then there are good chances that someone is spying on you. Also, if you see a sent message that you don’t remember sending, it is also a sign. Usually, the malware takes advantage of MMS so you can turn off the MMS auto download option. Now, the MMS will not automatically download on your phone; you have to tap on them.

## 4\. High Battery Usage

If your device has the spyware that means it is always recording your activity and sending it back to their makers. It means that the device will consume more battery and you have to search for the charger quickly. If your device is old, then it is pretty evident that the battery drains quickly. But if it is not then it could be a sign of spyware infection. You can check the battery usage in the settings to know which app is consuming more.

## 5\. High Data Usage

Spyware communicates with their command and control server (C&C) to get the instructions or upload the activity. They drain your device data to do that. If someone is spying on you, that means they are recording your calls, text messages, GPS Data, and even pictures you click. Your data subscription will end quickly in uploading all these information. So, if you are experiencing sudden high data usage, then it could be a sign of spyware. Check the data usage report to know which app is consuming it.

## 6\. Unusual Files or Folders

Spyware could create folders or files in a different format in your storage. They may use it to record your activity and then upload it to the server when your data signal is strong. So to detect spyware in your phone, check the storage, if you see unusual files or folders there, then it could be due to spyware. You can search Google to make sure what it is for using the file or folder name.

## 7\. Pop-ups or Ads in Notification Area

Most adware is also spyware. Yes, if you see ads on your android smartphone, then it means that you have adware. Adware displays ads on your device, and it also tracks your activity. It could monitor your browsing history, search history, cookies, list of the apps, phone book, and even GPS location. So, if you have adware infection that this means that someone could also spy on you. You should [remove the malware from your Android phone](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) right now.

## 8\. Unusual Noise during Phone Call

The call recording apps sometimes make strange noise during the phone call. So if you are experiencing call quality drop and noise, then it could be due to spyware. You could hear beep sound at the start of a call. However, the noise could be due to a network problem or problem in the speaker of your device.

## 9\. Use an Antimalware

All the above ways to detect the spyware are not 100% accurate. You cannot be confident even if you are experiencing all the above eight symptoms. These symptoms could appear due to any other reason. To make sure that your device has spyware, you should use an antimalware. It will scan your device and find the spyware.

[Download MalwareFox Antimalware](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)

There are lots of spying apps available on the play store. These apps don’t pretend to be anything else like Couple Tracker or GPS Phone Tracker. Such apps are genuine and only can appear on your phone if someone has installed it. The Antimalware would not catch these apps. You have to check the apps name and their purpose manually. If you find any such apps that you don’t remember installing, then you know what to do with them. Yes, trash them.

My phone has all the symtoms listed, but antimalware finds nothing. Everytime I do something on my phone, it gets gossiped, even thought I’m alone in my room in my home. There’s definitely something in there. Is there a way to get rid of it without getting a new phone with a new number and with Google account made from scratch etc?
