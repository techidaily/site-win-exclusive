**Our friend and graphic designer DJ Vargas has created another [DEX 3 DJ Software](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) Skin, and this time it’s a 4-Deck version with on-screen rotating platters that display album art.**

DJ Vargas is a long-time pro DJ and hails from Sweden, he’s a big fan of Denon DJ and the HC4500 DJ controller as you can see by the platter design in this new skin. [Here’s one of his previous DEX 3 Denon DJ skin submissions](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/).

DJ Vargas created this skin utilizing our free skin designer software. DEX 3’s graphics engine supports user-created skins utilizing our new and improved “[**PCDJ** **Skin Designe**r](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/).” This allows DEX 3 users to change the entire look and feel of the software. DEX 3 already comes equip with all new [4-Deck](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) and [2-Deck](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) default skins at all (_high_) resolutions, each with a re-designed [video mixing tab](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) (now with _separate preview windows_), effects grid tab and sampler tab. One of the new features in the skin designer is support for album art – either anywhere within the deck section, or on platters (jog-wheels) just like this skin.
