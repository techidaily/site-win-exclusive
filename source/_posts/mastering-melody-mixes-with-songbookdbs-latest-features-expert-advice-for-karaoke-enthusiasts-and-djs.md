**[Karaoki](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) with [SongbookDB](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) form a perfect duet of karaoke player and remote singer/song requests.**

One of the latest and KJ-pleasing features added to the **SongbookDB** remote song request system is the ability for singers to “**Tip the DJ**” from the free singers apps (Available for iOS and Android).

[LEARN MORE ABOUT SONGBOOKDB ![SongbookDB remote song requests](https://i0.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/songbookdb-requests.jpg?fit=348%2C415&ssl=1 "SongbookDB remote song requests")](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/)

All **SongbookDB** subscribers ($19-a-month) need to do is enter their Paypal email address and switch the “**Tip the DJ**” function on in [Business Details](https://www.songbookdb.com/docs/djs/songbookdbpal/businessDetails), then singers will see a “**Tip the DJ**” button at the bottom of your song book on their mobile device. Singer are also presented with the “**Tip the DJ**” button periodically among song search results.

When the singer clicks the button it easily allows them to **tip you $1, $2, $5, or $10 USD** – sent directly to your PayPal account.

**[SongbookDB](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) does not take a percentage of your singer tips** – the full amount minus Paypal’s fee (2.9% + $0.30 + any currency conversion fees) is credited directly to your Paypal account, and a notification of the amount and venue it was sent from is emailed to you. That way, if you have multiple karaoke hosts working for you, you can calculate which karaoke host should receive the tip.

Our partners at **SongBookDB** have truly created a robust, **remote singer/song request system** that’s both easy-to-use for your singers and the [Karaoki](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) karaoke host. **Song requests come directly into Karaoki** through the Karaoki remote request plug-in – making it super easy to ditch the printed songbooks for an online songbook solution that’s both green and modern.
