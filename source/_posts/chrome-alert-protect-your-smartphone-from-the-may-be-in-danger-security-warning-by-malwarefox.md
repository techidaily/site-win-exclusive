## Why Phone May Be in Danger Notification on Chrome?

Let’s be clear, you haven’t done anything wrong. You may have unwittingly given permission to a website to send you notifications. This could be after you’ve clicked an “Allow” button to download a file or watch a video, or even answered a seemingly harmless question such as “Are you above the age of 18?” 

These rogue websites use notifications to grab your attention, often scaring you with fake warnings. The moment you click on them, you’re directed to infected websites or tricked into downloading malicious files or apps.
