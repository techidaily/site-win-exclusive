It is classified as a [Potentially Unwanted Program (PUP)](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) since users don’t install it willingly on their system.

As you can see, the Win32:pup-gen PUP can cause many troubles to your system. It becomes vital to altogether remove it from the system once it has been recognized. 

Here are the top ways to remove Win32:pup-gen from Windows 10 system.

### **Delete all Files related to Win32:pup-gen**

If you were able to manually detect the Win32:pup-gen, then you must immediately delete it and all the files associated with it. Though it is hard to detect such PUPs manually as it comes with various names, some of them seems authentic.

### **Restart your PC in Safe Mode**

Windows Safe Mode is the perfect environment to find out and solve the critical errors in the system. In safe mode, only system programs and some crucial programs run. Safe Mode would most likely kill the applications and its files that try to run automatically on your system.

### **Uninstall Suspicious Applications**

Here are the steps to eliminate the temporary files:

1. Open the Run command window.
2. Type **%temp%** and hit the enter key.![temp run command](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/temp-run-command.png)
