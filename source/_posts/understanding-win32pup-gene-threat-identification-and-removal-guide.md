## Understanding Win32/PUP-Gene Threat: Identification & Removal Guide

Win32:pup-gen is a generic label for the malicious program detected by Avast and other antimalware programs. It is classified as a [Potentially Unwanted Program (PUP)](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) since users don’t install it willingly on their system. Instead, it comes hidden in a bundled software program and gets installed along with it.

## How to remove Win32:pup-gen from Windows 10?

As you can see, the Win32:pup-gen PUP can cause many troubles to your system. It becomes vital to altogether remove it from the system once it has been recognized. 

Here are the top ways to remove Win32:pup-gen from Windows 10 system.

### **Delete all Files related to Win32:pup-gen**

If you were able to manually detect the Win32:pup-gen, then you must immediately delete it and all the files associated with it. Though it is hard to detect such PUPs manually as it comes with various names, some of them seems authentic.

### **Delete Temporary Files**

The temporary files folder can also be a carrier of malicious files. Thus, we recommend deleting all the temporary files and folders regularly for the smooth running of the system. Removing the temporary files would also clear the unnecessary clutter from your system and free-up the valuable space.

Here are the steps to eliminate the temporary files:

1. Open the Run command window.
2. Type **%temp%** and hit the enter key.![temp run command](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/temp-run-command.png)
3. This run command would navigate you to this path: **_C:\\Users\\\[username\]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp,_** that is, the temp folder.

4. Select all Files and Folders of this folder and delete them. Don’t hesitate to delete them, as they are not essential for any of your tasks. ![Delete temp files](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Delete-temp-files.png)
5. Next right-click on the **Recycle Bin** and select **Empty Recycle Bin.**![Empty recycle bin](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Empty-recycle-bin.jpg)

****Is a PUP dangerous?** 

A potentially unwanted program (PUP) might not be dangerous by itself, but it often utilizes high amounts of system resources and can be responsible for the infiltration of other threatening malware.

****Should I delete PUP?** 

Though a PUP is not dangerous, it is still ‘Unwanted’. So it must be deleted from the system immediately after its discovery.
